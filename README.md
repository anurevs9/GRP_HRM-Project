# Human Resources Management System (HRMS)

This project is a web-based **Human Resources Management System (HRMS)** built using the **Django** web framework. It provides features for managing employees, departments, recruitment, payroll, and user authentication.

## Features

### User Authentication

- Employee profiles with details like name, email, phone, department, etc.

### Department Management

- CRUD operations for departments.
- Departments are linked to employees.
- Admin-only access for department creation and editing.

### Recruitment

- Employees can create new job postings.
- Application status tracking (e.g., open, closed, pending).

### Payroll

- Payroll record creation, including basic salary, overtime, bonuses, and deductions.
- Calculation of net salary.
- Integration with Razorpay for payment processing (requires Razorpay account and API keys).
- Automated email notifications to employees upon successful payment, including a detailed salary breakdown (using HTML email templates).
- Role-based access control to restrict payroll processing to authorized personnel.

### User Roles and Permissions

â”‚â”€â”€ hrm/          # HR-specific functionality like recruitment and payroll
â”‚â”€â”€ templates/    # HTML templates organized into subdirectories
â”‚â”€â”€ static/       # Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images)
â”‚â”€â”€ models.py     # Defines database models
â”‚â”€â”€ forms.py      # Defines Django forms for user input
â”‚â”€â”€ views.py      # Handles user requests, models, and forms
â”‚â”€â”€ urls.py       # Defines URL patterns for views
â”‚â”€â”€ decorators.py # Custom decorators for access control
â”‚â”€â”€ utils.py      # Utility functions
```

## Setup and Installation

- A Razorpay account and API keys (for payroll feature)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

### Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Ensure ********************`requirements.txt`******************** includes:*
